        <h2>Our Belief</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that students, no matter where they are, should be given the tools to learn and become future leaders, no matter the time of day. In many places, electricity access is taken for granted. For students in Ghana, the lack of reliable electricity after the sun sets makes it extremely hard to learn. Alternative lighting such as kerosene is environmentally degrading and unsafe. Flash Forward commits to providing solar-powered flashlights to help students study after sunset and remove an extremely unfair limitation on their potential.
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem: Education in Darkness</h2>
        <p>
          According to the World Bank, only about 85% of Ghana's urban population has access to electricity, while in rural areas, that figure drops to half. Nearly half of Ghana's rural students are left lightless after dark too. Without electricity, students are forced to rely on kerosene lamps or candles, both of which are hazardous, bad for the environment, and costly.
        </p>
        <p>Data from the Ghana Statistical Service reveals that:</p>
        <ul class="new">
          <li>Families spend an estimated $5-$10 per month on kerosene, which can amount to 10% of their total income.</li>
          <li>Smoke from kerosene lamps causes respiratory diseases, leading to health risks for children and their families.</li>
          <li>Light access after dark is a prominent problem for students in Ghana.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Flash Forward's Student-Driven Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that simple innovations can create significant impact. As a group of students ourselves, we truly understand the challenges students face, and we are taking action. Flash Forward aims to provide solar-powered flashlights to students in Ghana, ensuring they have the light they need to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          As students, we know firsthand about the struggle of balancing everything that comes with being a student; juggling academic pressure and other obligations can be daunting. We have a unique drive to lift students up, because students know students. This initiative is more than charity—it's about us coming together and making a tangible difference in the lives of our own.
        </p>
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
          We haven't distributed these flashlights yet, but with your help, we can. Your donation will go directly towards funding these crafted solar-powered flashlights. Every contribution, no matter its size, brings us closer to making this vision a reality.
